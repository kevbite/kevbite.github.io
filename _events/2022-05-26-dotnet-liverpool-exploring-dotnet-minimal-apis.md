talk-title: Exploring .NET Minimal APIs
talk-description: |
  The Minimal API story started in November 2019, it was introduced to eliminate the barrier to entry for creating C# APIs. Minimal APIs have minimal dependencies and are ideal for microservices and apps that will have minimum files, features, and dependencies in ASP.NET Core.
  In this session we'll take a look at the "what", "why" and "how" around the .NET Minimal APIs and how we can utilize these to make our API faster and more understandable. We'll also cover the new .NET Minimal APIs coming in .NET 7!
