talk-description: |
  If you know me, I’m passionate about testing, and what better than this talk I’ll be sharing my experience over the last 10+ years of testing APIs. This will cover the basics of how you get started with testing ASP.NET Core APIs, the layers I test at to prove our confidence in production, to how libraries and technology choices such as MongoDB and SQL Server make such a difference on your workflow with testing. We’ll also cover practices I use to ensure I don’t get bitten down the line when refactoring and updating the libraries.
