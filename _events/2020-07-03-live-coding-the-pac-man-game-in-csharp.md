talk-title: Live Coding the Pac-Man Game in C#
talk-description: |
  dotnetYork and YorkDevelopers hosted online stream sessions driven by a few main members, this included [me (Kevin Smith)](https://twitter.com/kev_bite), [David Betteridge](https://twitter.com/da_betteridge), and [Peter Gillett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-gillett-475794199/). The session was to live stream building the Pac-Man game via Twitch using the test driven development software engineering practices. We allowed the opportunity for other members to jump in to the stream and ask questions about process and how we was building the game.

  The game was written completely in C# and includes 3 hosts; Blazor Web Assembly, WinForms and also a console application.
