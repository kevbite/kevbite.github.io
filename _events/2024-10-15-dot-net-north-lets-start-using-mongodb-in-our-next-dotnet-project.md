talk-description: |
  I've had a passion for MongoDB since the first release of version 1. It's packed with features and is the most popular general-purpose document database out there. In this talk, we'll cover the reasons why we'd use MongoDB over traditional relational databases, and the many ways we can access and interact with our data within a .NET application.
