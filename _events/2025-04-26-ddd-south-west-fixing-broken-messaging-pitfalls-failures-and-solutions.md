talk-description: |
  Messaging is a fundamental part of distributed systems, but poor messaging practices can lead to performance bottlenecks, increased coupling, and system failures.

  In this session, we’ll explore the most common messaging pitfalls—such as excessive locking in handlers, oversized event payloads, improper deduplication strategies, and over-reliance on request-response messaging.

  We’ll break down how these issues impact system scalability and reliability, and more importantly, how to avoid them. Expect to see some examples using .NET and MassTransit, and insights into building resilient, event-driven architectures. 

  Whether you're new to messaging or looking to refine your patterns, this talk will help you design messaging workflows that are scalable, maintainable, and efficient.
