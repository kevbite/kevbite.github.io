talk-description: |
  I’ve been passionate about MongoDB since its very first release, and for good reason—it’s evolved into the most popular general-purpose document database, packed with powerful features. But why should you choose MongoDB over a traditional relational database, and how does it fit into a modern .NET application?

  In this talk, we’ll explore MongoDB from the ground up, starting with the raw power of BSON, moving through the MongoDB .NET driver, and finally diving into the brand-new MongoDB EF Core provider—a game-changer for developers familiar with Entity Framework. Whether you’re a seasoned .NET developer or just curious about NoSQL, this session will give you practical insights and techniques to harness the full potential of MongoDB in your applications.

  Join me to discover why MongoDB isn’t just an alternative to relational databases—it’s a paradigm shift for building scalable, high-performance .NET applications!
